# PixelFeatures

**PixelFeatures** is an open-source Android app designed to bring back and enhance missing or limited features for Google Pixel phone users. Built with Kotlin, it focuses on simple, customizable tools to improve your daily Pixel experience - especially for those who miss certain stock Android functionalities.

## Key Features
- **Sound Quick Settings Tile**: A custom tile in your notification panel that instantly opens the device's volume controller (media slider) with a single tap. Long-press opens the full sound settings for quick adjustments. No more digging through menus!
- **Double-Tap to Sleep Widget**: Add a home screen widget that locks your screen with a double-tap. Perfect for Pixel users who want a quick way to put their device to sleep without physical buttons. (Requires enabling the app's Accessibility Service.)
- **Accessibility Integration**: Leverages Android's Accessibility Service for secure screen locking, ensuring compatibility and minimal battery impact.

This project was created to fill gaps in Pixel's feature set, like the absence of a dedicated sound tile in Quick Settings and easy double-tap sleep options. It's lightweight, customizable, and easy to integrate into your Pixel setup.
